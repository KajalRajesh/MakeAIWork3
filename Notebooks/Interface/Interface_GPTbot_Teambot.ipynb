    "This code appears to be a Python script that includes several import statements and defines various functions and variables. Here's an explanation of the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code imports various libraries and modules, including os, time, torch, openai, random, numpy, pandas, seaborn, torch.nn, matplotlib.pyplot, torchvision.transforms, torch.utils.data, torchvision.models, scipy.spatial.distance, sklearn.metrics, torchvision.datasets, and sentence_transformers. These libraries are used for tasks such as data manipulation, deep learning, image processing, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code checks whether a GUI (Graphical User Interface) is available by assigning the device variable to \"cuda\" if a GPU is available; otherwise, it assigns \"cpu\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code sets some constants and hyperparameters such as num_classes, image_size, batch_size, and apples_quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Based on the num_classes value, the code assigns different paths for loading the pre-trained ResNet and Team models, as well as the test data directory and the class labels. The paths depend on the availability of CUDA (GPU) support.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code loads the pre-trained ResNet model from the pytorch/vision repository using the torch.hub.load() function. It replaces the fully connected layer (fc) of ResNet with a new linear layer with the appropriate number of output classes (num_classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code loads the pre-trained Team model using torch.load() and moves it to the specified device.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code defines a transformation pipeline for the test data, including resizing, converting to a tensor, and normalizing the image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code loads the test dataset using ImageFolder from the specified test data directory and applies the defined transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code creates a data loader for managing the test data batches using the DataLoader class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code defines a function named get_model that takes a data loader and a model as input and returns the predicted labels (y_pred) and true labels (y_true) for the given model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code calls the get_model function for both the ResNet and Team models using the test data loader, obtaining the predicted labels (y_pred_resnet, y_pred_team) and true labels (y_true_resnet, y_true_team) for both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code initializes empty lists to store the predicted labels and true labels for both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code initializes variables for calculating test loss, correct predictions, and a criterion for the loss function (nn.CrossEntropyLoss()).\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code disables gradient calculation using torch.no_grad() to speed up inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inside the torch.no_grad() context, the code sets the models to evaluation mode using model_resnet.eval() and model_team.eval().\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code iterates over the test data using a for loop, making predictions for both the ResNet and Team models. It calculates the loss, updates the correct predictions count, and appends the predicted and true labels to the corresponding lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "    After the loop, the code calculates the average test losses for both models and the test accuracies as the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code formats the test accuracies and losses as strings with appropriate precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The code defines several helper functions for error message boxes, calculating the percentage of bad apples in a sample, classifying batches based on the percentage of bad apples, labeling apple classes, generating pie charts, and the main function for calculating and updating the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The main function."
